        Python is very easy to use, powerful, and versatile. It has become the
        language of choice for many IoT developers. One of the main reasons for
        the popularity of Python is the developer community. Python developers
        have created and made available many specific modules that can be
        imported into any program to immediately lend added functionality.
        Python is a high-level programming language. It is easy for beginners to
        learn and widely utilized in many scientific areas for data assessment.
        This lab is an overview of the Python programming language for learners
        without prior programming knowledge. It follows the concept of
        object-oriented programming and has graphical user interface-driven
        applications. The examples and difficulties used in this lab are drawn
        from numerous areas like text processing, simple graphics creation, and
        image manipulation, Data Science and visualization, Desktop GUI,
        hypertext mark-up language, and web development.
